An encoder and decoder implemented by java for the "VCDIFF Generic Differencing and Compression Data Format" described by [RFC 3284] .

The encoding strategy is largely based on Bentley-McIlroy 99: "[Data Compression Using Long Common Strings]."

This lib has a simple API, go though VcdiffEncode / VcdiffDecode to get the usage.
